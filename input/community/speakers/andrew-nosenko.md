I'm a problem solver at heart with special interest in asynchrony, concurrency and multithreading with .NET and C#.
Although I don't have a lot of public speaking experience, I gave a few talks at Sydney ALT.NET meetup and one of them, "Asynchronous coroutines with C#", was accepted for .NET Conf: https://youtu.be/pE6b2Bs3U9Q.
I'm also active on StackOverflow, where I believe I've contributed some interesting questions and answers.
